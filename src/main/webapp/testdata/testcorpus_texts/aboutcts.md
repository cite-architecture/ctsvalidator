# About CTS #


## What is CTS? ##


CTS stands for *Canonical Text Services*. The CTS protocol defines a series of requests that a CTS installation must recognize, and schemas for validating XML replies to each request.

A complete text browsing and reading system can be constructed without any prior knowledge of the contents of a CTS installation using these three CTS requests:

-   GetCapabilities
-   GetValidReff
-   GetPassagePlus

In CTS, all references to texts are expressed with CTS URNs.

## What is CTS URN notation? ##

CTS URN notation is a type of Uniform Resource Name, an Internet Engineering Taskforce standard for identifiers with a specified
semantics that are persistent and technology-independent. CTS URNs express the OHCO2 semantics of text, a very general structural and
functional model of citable text.
